# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
It looked a little intimidating at first but I am confident I understand it really well.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
It was exciting to see the previous skills come together into this one! I still feel like I am doing well with productive struggle. I am trying hard not to spend too much time struggling and knowing when to go google something.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I was thinking this to myself and decided I want to go back to other lessons and learn the technical terminology of all that we've learned. I think I can improve my note-taking now that I am getting the hang of it. I have some gaps in my calendar, including empty days on weekends that I am hoping to add an hour or two to do these things.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
No questions yet! I know I can reach out to my previous pairing partners, small group, or even the mod0 group. Before reaching out to others, I attempt to google things myself. If google is not getting me answers, I will reach out before coming into an unproductive struggle.
